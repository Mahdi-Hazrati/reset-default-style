`reset-default-style` is a minimal CSS reset package that removes default styles from HTML elements. It's perfect for developers who want to start with a clean slate and avoid any unexpected styling issues.

## Why use reset-default-style?
By default, every HTML element comes with some pre-defined styles. This can often lead to inconsistent results across different browsers and devices. `reset-default-style` solves this problem by removing all default styles and providing a consistent baseline for your styling needs.

Here are some of the benefits of using `reset-default-style`:

- **Consistent styling** : All HTML elements will have a uniform appearance across different browsers and devices.

- **Easy customization** : Since all default styles have been removed, you're free to add your own styles without worrying about conflicts or overrides.

- **Improved accessibility** : reset-default-style includes accessibility-friendly defaults like removing outlines on focused elements and setting default font sizes and line heights.

```
Then import it into your project:

```js
import 'reset-default-style';
```
Once you've included the CSS file, all default styles will be removed and you'll have a clean slate to work with.
